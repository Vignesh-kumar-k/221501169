# React URL Shortener Web App

A lightweight, user-friendly client-side URL shortener built with React and Material UI. The application allows users to shorten URLs, set custom shortcodes, define expiration time, and view analytics â€” all while integrating a reusable logging middleware to track actions and improve observability.
